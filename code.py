Then, rank the movies based on their matching degree, like the fine-tuning process of a recommendation system, and put the highest matching movie first."
        "First, the user especially likes drama movies, so movies with Drama should be prioritized. Then, Romance and Comedy, especially when these types are combined with Drama, may be more in line with the user's taste. Additionally, the user's history includes several movies with comedic elements, such as 'Babe' and 'The American President', so single comedies may also be good, but may not be as good as those combined with Drama.\n"   
        "Now, let's analyze each remaining movie:\n"  
  
        "1. **Touch (Romance)**: Pure romance type, the user's history includes several romantic movies, but usually combined with Drama, such as 'Sliding Doors' and 'Ever After'. Pure romance may be slightly weaker, but still has a high match, but may not be as good as those with Drama.\n"  
  
        "2. **Sister Act (Comedy, Crime)**: Comedy and crime. The user's history does not include crime types, but comedy is a type the user likes. However, the crime type may not be very consistent with the user's habits, but because it is a high match, it may be due to the comedy part. But need to look at other factors, such as the starring Whoopi Goldberg may be popular, but it is not certain whether the user likes this type of comedy.\n"  
  
        "3. **Airplane! (Comedy)**: Pure comedy, a classic comedy film. The user likes comedy, but may prefer comedy with drama combined, but if it is a classic comedy, it may still be a good choice.\n"  
          
        "4. **La Collectionneuse (Drama)**: Drama movie, directed by Ã‰ric Rohmer, French New Wave, may be more artistic. Does the user like this style? The history is mostly American drama movies, so it is not very certain, but because it is Drama, it may still be prioritized.\n"  
  
        "5. **Groove (Drama)**: A drama movie about electronic music parties, may be more youthful. The user's history does not include music-related movies, but Drama is the core, so it may be suitable.\n"  
  
        "6. **Naked Gun 33 1/3 (Comedy)**: Spoof comedy, the user may like it, but like Airplane!, whether the user prefers comedy with drama combined?\n"  
  
        "7. **Max Dugan Returns (Comedy)**: Family comedy, the user's history includes 'Babe', which is children's and comedy, so it may be suitable, but need to look at the starring or director whether it has appeal.\n"  
  
        "8. **Shadowlands (Drama, Romance)**: Combining Drama and Romance, the user's history includes several movies of this type, such as 'Ever After' and 'Great Expectations', so it may be very consistent. Starring Anthony Hopkins and Debra Winger, may add points.\n"  
  
        "9. **The Good Mother (Drama)**: Pure drama, involving family disputes, the user likes serious drama movies, such as 'Philadelphia', so it may be suitable.\n"  
  
        "10. **One Crazy Summer (Comedy)**: Youth comedy, 80s style, does the user like it? May not be as good as other comedies, but still has a high match.\n"  
  
        "11. **Sirens (Comedy, Drama)**: Comedy and drama, combining the two types the user likes, may be more prioritized than pure comedy. Directed by John Duigan, starring Hugh Grant, may attract users who like romantic comedies.\n"  
  
        "12. **Passion Fish (Drama)**: Female protagonist's drama movie, involving rehabilitation and interpersonal relationships, the user's history includes similar serious themes, such as 'Dead Man Walking', so it may be very consistent.\n"  
  
        "Next, we need to compare the matching degree of these movies with the user's preferences. The user clearly prefers serious drama movies, especially those with emotional depth or social issues, such as 'Philadelphia' and 'In the Name of the Father'. Romantic elements usually appear as secondary types, such as 'Sliding Doors'. In terms of comedy, the user may prefer comedies with dramatic depth, such as the comedic elements in 'The American President' combined with political drama.\n"  
  
        "So, the ranking should prioritize movies that have both Drama and Romance, followed by pure Drama, then Drama combined with other secondary types the user likes (such as Comedy), and finally pure Comedy.\n\n"  
  
        "Specifically:\n"  
  
        "- **Shadowlands** (Drama, Romance) combines two types the user likes, and the theme may be more profound, about the love story of writer C.S. Lewis, suitable for users who like emotional depth.\n"  
  
        "- **Passion Fish** (Drama) involves female rehabilitation, may be emotionally rich, consistent with the user's preferences.\n"  
  
        "- **The Good Mother** (Drama) is a serious family drama, similar to the user's watched 'Philadelphia'.\n"  
  
        "- **Sirens** (Comedy, Drama) combines the two, may be closer to the user's preferred type.\n"  
  
        "- **La Collectionneuse** (Drama) although it is a French art film, does the user like this style? May be ranked later.\n"  
  
        "- **Groove** (Drama) is youthful, but it is not certain whether the theme is consistent with the user's history.\n"  
  
        "- **Touch** (Romance) is pure romance, may not be as good as those combined with Drama.\n"  
  
        "- **Sister Act** (Comedy, Crime) the comedy part may be suitable, but the crime type the user has not watched.\n"  
  
        "- **Airplane!**, **Naked Gun**, **Max Dugan Returns**, **One Crazy Summer** are all pure comedies or mainly comedies, the user may like them, but not as prioritized as those with Drama.\n"  
  
        "In addition, the starring and director may also affect. For example, Anthony Hopkins in 'Shadowlands' may be more attractive, while 'Sirens' has Hugh Grant, does the user like romantic comedy actors?\n"  
  
        "Combining these factors, the possible ranking is:\n"  
  
        "1. **Shadowlands** (Drama, Romance)\n"  
        "2. **Passion Fish** (Drama)\n"  
        "3. **The Good Mother** (Drama)\n"  
        "4. **Sirens** (Comedy, Drama)\n"  
        "5. **La Collectionneuse** (Drama)\n"  
        "6. **Groove** (Drama)\n"  
        "7. **Touch** (Romance)\n"  
        "8. **Airplane!** (Comedy)\n"  
        "9. **Sister Act** (Comedy, Crime)\n"  
        "10. **Max Dugan Returns** (Comedy)\n"  
        "11. **Naked Gun 33 1/3** (Comedy)\n"  
        "12. **One Crazy Summer** (Comedy)\n"  
        "But need to check if there are other factors, such as release time, ratings, etc., but the user did not provide this information, so can only be based on type and theme."
