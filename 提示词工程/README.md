# Prompt-MovieRecommender

A movie recommendation system that uses different prompting strategies with Large Language Models.

## Project Overview

This project implements various prompt engineering strategies to improve movie recommendations based on user preferences. The system analyzes a user's viewing history and provides personalized movie recommendations using LLM-based analysis.

## Prompt Strategies

1. **Basic Strategy**: Initial implementation with simple prompts
2. **Chain-of-Thought**: Enhanced prompting with step-by-step reasoning
3. **Few-Shot Learning**: Providing examples to guide the model toward better recommendations

## Files

- `code9.py`: Main implementation with few-shot prompting
- `test9.py`: Testing framework for the movie recommendation system
- Various other test implementations with different strategies

## Results

The system's performance is measured using NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain) to evaluate recommendation quality.
