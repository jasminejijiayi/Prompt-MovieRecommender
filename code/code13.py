Then rank the movies by their matching degree, like the fine-tuning process of a recommendation system, and put the highest-matching movies first."
        "First, the user especially likes Drama films, so movies with Drama should be prioritized. Then comes Romance and Comedy, especially when these genres are combined with Drama. Additionally, the user's history includes several movies with comedic elements, such as 'Babe' and 'The American President', so pure comedies might also be good, but maybe not as good as those combined with Drama.\n"   
        "Now, let's analyze each of the remaining movies:\n"  
  
        "1. **Touch (Romance)**: Pure Romance genre, the user's history includes several romantic movies, but usually combined with Drama, such as 'Sliding Doors' and 'Ever After'. Pure Romance might be slightly weaker, but still high-matching, but maybe not as good as those with Drama.\n"  
  
        "2. **Sister Act (Comedy, Crime)**: Comedy and Crime. The user's history does not include Crime films, but Comedy is a preferred genre. However, the Crime genre might not be as suitable for the user, but since it's high-matching, it might be due to the Comedy part. But we need to consider other factors, such as the starring actress Whoopi Goldberg, who might be popular, but it's unclear if the user likes this type of comedy.\n"  
  
        "3. **Airplane! (Comedy)**: Pure Comedy, a classic comedy film. The user likes Comedy, but might prefer those with Drama combined. However, if it's a classic comedy, it might still be a good choice.\n"  
          
        "4. **La Collectionneuse (Drama)**: Drama film, directed by Ã‰ric Rohmer, French New Wave, might be more artistic. Does the user like this type of film? The user's history mostly includes American dramas, so it's unclear, but since it's Drama, it might still be prioritized.\n"  
  
        "5. **Groove (Drama)**: A drama film about electronic music parties, might be more youthful. The user's history does not include music-related films, so it's unclear if the theme matches the user's history.\n"  
  
        "6. **Naked Gun 33 1/3 (Comedy)**: Spoof comedy, the user might like it, but similar to Airplane!, is it more preferred with Drama combined?\n"  
  
        "7. **Max Dugan Returns (Comedy)**: Family comedy, the user's history includes 'Babe', which is a children's and comedy film, so it might be suitable, but we need to consider the starring actors or director.\n"  
  
        "8. **Shadowlands (Drama, Romance)**: Combines Drama and Romance, the user's history includes several films of this type, such as 'Ever After' and 'Great Expectations', so it might be very matching. The starring actors Anthony Hopkins and Debra Winger might add to its appeal.\n"  
  
        "9. **The Good Mother (Drama)**: Pure Drama, involving family conflicts, the user likes serious drama films, such as 'Philadelphia', so it might be suitable.\n"  
  
        "10. **One Crazy Summer (Comedy)**: Teen comedy, 80s style, does the user like it? It might not be as good as other comedies, but still high-matching.\n"  
  
        "11. **Sirens (Comedy, Drama)**: Comedy and Drama, combining the user's preferred genres, might be more prioritized than pure comedies. The director John Duigan and starring actor Hugh Grant might appeal to users who like romantic comedies.\n"  
  
        "12. **Passion Fish (Drama)**: A drama film with a female lead, involving rehabilitation and interpersonal relationships, the user's history includes similar serious themes, such as 'Dead Man Walking', so it might be very matching.\n"  
  
        "Next, we need to compare the themes of these movies with the user's preferences. The user clearly prefers serious drama films, especially those with emotional depth or social issues, such as 'Philadelphia' and 'In the Name of the Father'. Romantic elements usually appear as secondary genres, such as 'Sliding Doors'. Comedy-wise, the user might prefer comedies with dramatic depth, such as the comedic elements in 'The American President' combined with political drama.\n"  
  
        "So, the ranking should prioritize movies that combine Drama and Romance, followed by pure Drama, then Drama combined with other secondary genres the user likes (such as Comedy), and finally pure Comedy.\n\n"  
  
        "Specifically:\n"  
  
        "- **Shadowlands** (Drama, Romance) combines two genres the user likes, and the theme might be more profound, about the love story of author C.S. Lewis, suitable for users who like emotional depth.\n"  

        "- **Passion Fish** (Drama) involves a female lead's rehabilitation, might be emotionally rich, matching the user's preferences.\n"  
  
        "- **The Good Mother** (Drama) is a serious family drama, similar to the user's watched film 'Philadelphia'.\n"  
  
        "- **Sirens** (Comedy, Drama) combines two genres, might be more appealing to the user.\n"  
  
        "- **La Collectionneuse** (Drama) is a French art film, but does the user like this type of film? Maybe ranked lower.\n"  
  
        "- **Groove** (Drama) is a youthful film, but it's unclear if the theme matches the user's history.\n"  
  
        "- **Touch** (Romance) is pure Romance, might not be as good as those combined with Drama.\n"  
  
        "- **Sister Act** (Comedy, Crime) has a comedic part that might be suitable, but the Crime genre is not in the user's history.\n"  
  
        "- **Airplane!**, **Naked Gun**, **Max Dugan Returns**, **One Crazy Summer** are all pure comedies or mainly comedies, the user might like them, but not as prioritized as those with Drama.\n"  
  
        "Additionally, the starring actors and directors might also influence. For example, Anthony Hopkins in 'Shadowlands' might be more appealing, while 'Sirens' has Hugh Grant, does the user like romantic comedy actors? 'Airplane!' is a classic, might have broad appeal.\n"  
  
        "Considering these factors, the possible ranking is:\n"  
  
        "1. **Shadowlands** (Drama, Romance)\n"  
        "2. **Passion Fish** (Drama)\n"  
        "3. **The Good Mother** (Drama)\n"  
        "4. **Sirens** (Comedy, Drama)\n"  
        "5. **La Collectionneuse** (Drama)\n"  
        "6. **Groove** (Drama)\n"  
        "7. **Touch** (Romance)\n"  
        "8. **Airplane!** (Comedy)\n"  
        "9. **Sister Act** (Comedy, Crime)\n"  
        "10. **Max Dugan Returns** (Comedy)\n"  
        "11. **Naked Gun 33 1/3** (Comedy)\n"
